Portable Open Hospital
----------------------
 
The main purpose of Portable Open Hospital (POH) is to create a version of Open Hospital that you can take along with you and run it on any computer you like keeping the data you have saved. With POH we also hope to reach the goal to make Open Hospital easily installable so that even somebody with no experience of Java and MySQL can try or use it.

POH allows to use Open Hospital on a computer, easily move the installation on another computer or even run it from a USB stick or drive. All you have to do is to copy the root installation directory of POH to your favourite path, the program and the data will be kept. 

POH uses its own version of the Java Virtual Machine and the MySQL server and everything is contained in the root installation directory.

POH is released under the GNU GPL License. The Linux version has been tested on Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 "Etch" and Ubuntu Linux 7.10 "The Gutsy Gibbon". Bugs and problems should be reported to Fabrizio Lippolis <flippolis@gmail.com>.
